👋 Hi there! I'm KADOUMA Abdelhak, a passionate computer science student with a keen interest in web development, AI technologies, cloud computing, and virtualization.

🌐 Aspiring DevOps engineer and full-stack web developer, I love building robust and efficient applications that leverage the power of modern technologies. Currently, I'm focused on honing my skills in JavaScript, Django, Python, and React to create innovative and scalable solutions.

💼 Currently working on :

1️⃣ The AC3 project rely on AI/ML techniques to build application profiles and contexts that will answer questions such as: What type of traffic? When and where are the traffic and data generated? The profile will then be used by the CECCM to predict the suitable placement of the microservices on the CECC infrastructure or trigger the appropriate LCM actions (i.e., migration or duplication), anticipating resource outage due to, for example, a potential data avalanche or high CPU usage. The profile specification will leverage web semantic and ontology to ease the adaptability of LCM actions to take the right decisions on the application and CECC infrastructure and adapt according to the changes in the users need.


📚 Continuously expanding my knowledge and skillset in DevOps practices, including automation, containerization, and deployment pipelines. Eager to explore and implement DevOps tools and methodologies to streamline development workflows and improve application scalability and reliability.

🔭 Passionate about exploring the intersection of AI technologies and web development, with a strong focus on leveraging cloud resources and virtualization techniques to build intelligent and efficient applications.

🌱 Always learning, always growing! Excited to collaborate on open-source projects, connect with fellow developers, and contribute to the tech community. Let's build amazing things together!
